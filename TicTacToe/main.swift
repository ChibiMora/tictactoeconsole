The way the board is set up there are three empty rows crossesctioned by 3 empty columns. \n So much like a traditional Tic Tac Toe board there it is a 3x3 grid. Your quest is to make a 3 in a row of your letter. This can be either horizontal, vertically, or diagnol. You enter your selection by inputing as if this were a graph. For example if you wanted to put your letter in the top right corner you would enter 1,3, or in the middle 2,2 or bottom left 3,1. First one to complete the quest wins!\n"
